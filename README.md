# Bank-Customer-Data-Visulization-Hub-OS_HACKATHON
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing web interface that presents the dataset in a structured and engaging manner. The dataset includes various attributes such as customer demographics (age, job, marital status, education), financial details (balance, housing loan, personal loan), contact information, and web interaction data (Operating Systems, Browser, Region, and Traffic Type).

To effectively represent and analyze the data, the website features four types of data visualizations:

3D Graphs – Provide an immersive and detailed representation of multi-dimensional data.
Histograms – Display the distribution of numerical data, such as customer age and financial balance.
Pie Charts – Visually illustrate categorical data, such as job distribution or loan approval rates.
Bar Plots – Compare various customer attributes, such as education levels versus income balance.
The combination of these visual tools enhances data interpretation, making insights easily understandable for users. The website ensures a seamless experience by incorporating dynamic and interactive elements, enabling users to explore trends efficiently.
